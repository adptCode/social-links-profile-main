### What I learned

Iâ€™ve learned a lot about CSS interactions, especially how `:hover`,  `:focus `, and `:focus-within` work. Initially, I struggled with getting the :focus state to apply properly to my .card-element, but I realized that the issue was caused by the fact that links (`<a>`) inside the `.card-element` were naturally focusable, stealing the focus from the parent container.

To fix this, I learned that `:focus-within` is a better choice when I want the focus effect to apply to the entire `.card-element` whenever any child element (like an `<a>`) is focused. This small change made my styles work correctly both for hover effects and keyboard navigation.

Additionally, I discovered how to remove or customize the default focus outline using `outline: none`; while keeping accessibility in mind. Instead of completely removing it, I learned to use `:focus-visible` to apply focus styles only when navigating with the keyboard, which improves usability without affecting mouse clicks.

Finally, I improved the visual smoothness of my interactions by adding a transition effect, making the color changes feel more natural. Now, my `.card-element` design is both visually appealing and fully accessible, working well for both mouse and keyboard users.
